<p><img class= "star" src="star.jpg">Eventually,constant growth brings you to a certain monotony.<br>you find no dearest around.<br>That's exactly the point where you may slide down via excuses or be a pheonix.</p>

<p><img class= "star" src="star.jpg">No one's a demon,
<br> just they aren't an angel to you.
<br><br>
<p><img class= "star" src="star.jpg"> For long I blamed you for my scars
<br>Little did I know it was fault in our stars</p>
<br><br>
<p><img class= "star" src="star.jpg">Life is as good as wind chime
<br>It has got vibes with perfect rhyme
<br>Don't fall in trap of troubles
<br>Keep blowing elated bubbles</p>

Forever~
Forever is an incomplete truth. Nothing is forever until it's not bound. <br>The trees stand forever until they are bound by ground. The seas are forever because they are bound by nature.<br> The north and south pole are together since they are bound by attractions. Eternity is comforting myth. <br>Forever is truth till you want it to be true. Donot create a self-illusion with someone or something.<br>
 So next time you say forever, ask yourself are you bound by it?
