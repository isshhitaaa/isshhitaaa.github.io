<div class="right">

<p>This is a meassge from writer to all the readers. First,hearty thank you to everybody who is visiting this page. I just wanted to share few words with you all.
I could never think i would write . Neither did i read books in 8th standard. But as it was rat-race among classmate(and I was a indeed part of it),I wrote a poem. 
Everybody loved it. Praised it. But then was time i realised that what was need to write. Why so many people are holding a pen in their hand. actually, every writer 
has two things: pen (which everybody sees) and a bunch of thoughts(which no body sees).And that's it! you are a writer! So, all you need is some experience and 
willingness to vomit those thoughts out so beautifully that it hits straight to reader's heart. Offcourse the beauty keeps magnifying as you keep studying but that's
a gradual process. Trust me you all are writers. We all suffer pain , emotions, tragidies and that is what binds us all. That is what connects us. you can relate to my
every work. Because i pick circumstances that we all have suffered at some point of time. The words we needed to hear at that time. So, I hope you like my work . You can 
always reach me for suggestions of any kind. It's always appreciated. Thank you! keep reading.!
