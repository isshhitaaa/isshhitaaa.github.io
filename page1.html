<h1 class="title">Mistakes(Reverse poem)</h1>
<p>I was hurting myself so bad</p>

<p>But foolishly I thought that

</p><p>I became stronger my committing mistakes

</p><p>Because now when I look back

</p><p>A good destiny is what I lack

</p><p>Sometimes I self-sympathize by saying

</p><p>My Pure intention one day be overweighting

</p><p>But the mirror always then reminded me

</p><p>Being loved was never my cup of tea.

<h1 class="title" >Take a moment</h1>
<p>
In the world of work and wars,
</p><p>our souls became so bitter and sour
</p><p>"this is mine , that is yours"
</p><p>but,think do we <break>fight for?
</p><p>jealousy also called j-factor
</p><p>has indeed become our character
</p><p>hate,ego labelled as self-respect
</p><p>Is now life's greatest aspect</p>
<br>

<p>praises, no, never!</p>
<p>We can't praise someone ever
</p><p>but we are capable to criticize
</p><p>ya we are ready to back bite.
<br>
</p><p>Take a moment for appreciation
</p><p>take a moment for recreation
</p><p>Learn to ignore small issues
</p><p>anger is just use and throw tissue
<br>
<p>don't crib about ups and downs
</p><p>everyone has a fall
</p>just get up and wear the crown<p>
<br>
</p>don't cry if your dearest didn't come<p>
may be he's busy with his own run</p>
<p>don't be a moon which waits for sunlight,
</p><p>to shine with tinge of blue and white
</p><p>Be a sun to enlighten everone's day</p>
<p>Be a sun to shower positive rays</p>
<br><br>

<div class="third-poem">
<h1 class="title" >THRILLS AND THORNS</h1>
<p>one in the  bight crowd
</p><p>out so silent,inside yelling loud
</p><p>all around voices were coming
</p><p>heart was pumping,mind was numbing
</break>
<p>Stepping in an over crowded rat-race
</p><p>weird world, all busy in their own space
</p><p>seeked,"catch your dreams at any cost,
</p><p>World is no more gleamy as frost"</p>
<break>
<p>Geared up for what I came
</p><p>offcourse it was not an easy game
</p><p>sweating and freezing at same time
</p><p>everyone around sour and lime
</p><p>falling and standing back and again
</p><p>finally stood at the end
</p><p>giggling,dancing under the rain

</p><p>Chilling at night, burning in day
<p>Preparing for more thrills on the way.</p>
